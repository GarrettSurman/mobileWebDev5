                <div class="break"></div>
                <li>Unicorns live in groups of four or five that make up a joyous family. The head of the family is an elder unicorn who is hundreds of years old. Other family members include a loving couple and one or two young unicorns.
                    Unicorn families spend their lives alone living in peace deep in the forest.</li>

                <div class="break"></div>
                <li>When two unicorn families meet, they express great joy and travel together for weeks before they part and go their separate ways.</li>

                <div class="break"></div>
                <li> The unicorn may eat grass and hay, but it really doesn’t need to eat at all. It absorbs its energy from the sun, probably through the horn.</li>

                <div class="break"></div>
                <li>Unicorns can be any color, from jet-black and brown to dazzling gold, brilliant red or pure white.
                    Anyone who touches a pure white unicorn will find happiness and joy for his entire life.
                    The unicorn’s eyes are sky blue or purple.</li>

                <div class="break"></div>
                <li>Unicorns are earthbound and do not have wings. If a unicorn and a Pegasus (a flying horse) mate, the babies may become flying unicorns.</li>
